# understanding the Platypus UX:
#
# when clicked in the status bar, a Platypus status menu app runs (without arguments) to completion
# and displays each line of STDOUT as an option, so it's critical to complete ASAP to reduce perceived latency
#
# then when a menu item is selected, this script runs again in the background w/ the menu item text passed as an arg
# this time Platyplus app will not wait for the background run to complete before the menu can be rendered again
#
# understanding this script:
#
# check dependencies and if passing, source the main mdm functionality
# otherwise offer a single option to install dependencies when selected
#
# the depedency check should run every time in case its copied to new computer
