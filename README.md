Magento Docker Manager (MDM) is a cross platform (Mac/Linux/Windows) application to run multiple, simultaneous Magento
applications on your local system via Docker. Once installed, simply select options from the available menu items to
manage your applications.

MDM's menus are **contextual**. Only applicable options are shown. For example, if a tool is not installed, you will
be prompted to install it before continuing to unlock a feature. If the application is stopped, you'll be prompted it
to start it for additional menu options.

MDM has 2 general audiences: 
1. End users who might use the Magento app for demos, testing/QA, or training
2. Developers who want to develop/test locally on a Magento Cloud like env or want to configure a packaged app for
their team of end users

# MDM End Users

End users experience MDM almost entirely through the contextual menus. Below is every possible menu item *(in the 
order they would appear if they are applicable)* with some additional notes if appropiate. If you do not see a particular
menu item, then MDM has determined it's not currently appropiate. Many items only become available after toggling
**Advanced** mode on.

## Frequently Asked Qestions (FAQ)

### "How do I spoof domains?" or "Why is my certificate invalid?"

By default, the option to "spoof" (mimic) any domain is disabled. You should not enable it on a computer that you share or allow others access too. If a malicious user gains access to your system, they might use it to spoof legitimate domains. With that caveat, it's still very useful. To enable it, enable advance mode, then go to the maintenance menu, then toggle the spoofing option on.

### "What is the default admin username and password?"

The values are inherited from the Magento Cloud Docker project [here](https://github.com/magento/magento-cloud-docker/blob/bc964b272b6c40e2b1b2c8832ef56d40182cbd99/src/Config/Dist/Generator.php#L183)

### "How do I setup and where do I place my auth.json file?"

Follow the instructions [here](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/install-gde/prereq/dev_install.html#instgde-prereq-compose-clone-auth) with 1 clarification: place your `auth.json` file in your `~/.composer/` directory so the full, explicit path will be: `/Users/<yourusername>/.composer/auth.json` on OSX or `/home/<yourusername>/.composer/auth.json` on Linux systems.

Note for OSX users: You will not see the `.composer` dir in your user (Home) dir in `Finder` unless you press **⌘ (command) + shift + . (dot)**. Also be careful that the editor used to create your `auth.json` file does not insert special characters (e.g. curly quotes for double quotes). MDM will attempt to validate the format of `auth.json` and report if it detects such errors.

### "What's auth.json used for?"

You may have downloaded or received a pre-bundled app with all the required modules, but if you need/want to run `composer update` to get future updates OR you want to create your own app, you will need an `auth.json` file. Also the GitHub token in the `auth.json` file is used to configure/download additional features of MDM (e.g. valid wildcard TLS certificates, web tunneling, etc.)

### "What does this error mean?"

Whichever error you encounter, please check (i.e. search) to see if your [issue](https://github.com/PMET-public/mdm/issues?q=is%3Aissue) has already been reported and possibly solved. If not, please open a new one.

### "How do I upgrade WITHOUT preserving old installations? (i.e. start over)"

In a terminal, run `rm -rf ~/.mdm` and the follow any instructions from the MDM menu afterward. Then ensure advanced mode is toggled on to see the maintenance menu. From the maintenance menu, prune everything except images. The Docker VM is now cleaned from old installs, and you can also remove any old MDM apps from the host computer.

# Prebuilt Apps Instructions & FAQ

DO NOT DOWNLOAD APPS FROM THE ONEDRIVE WEB UI. USE FINDER. - Currently, OSX prevents apps downloaded via the web UI from running. We are looking into possible solutions.

Copy any MDM app from your synced OneDrive folder to another local folder like Downloads or Documents.

Double click the local app and look for the Magento icon in your menu bar.


# Frequently Asked Questions

## What's the difference between the "bundled-new" apps and the "cloned" apps?

The "bundled-new" apps have all the composer dependencies bundled with them and will install a new Magento store from the beginning. No composer credentials are required to run, but they will be required to update.

The "cloned" apps represent a snapshot of sample Magento install just after installation has completed. Credentials will be required to run, but because it is a snapshot of an already installed app, the initial start up will be **MUCH faster.**

## What is MDM-lite?

It's a version of MDM with no associated Magento application, so it downloads from OneDrive and starts up almost instantly.

Despite no associated app, MDM-lite still has several uses such as:
- cloning your existing envs instead of using one of the pre-made, generic apps.
- running PWA against remote back-ends
- getting support access for your local systme

# Certs FAQ

## How MDM creates/retrieves & stores certs

Certs for a hostname are stored in a directory of the same name. For example, certs for `test.example.com` are stored in `~/.mdm/certs/test.example.com/`

Wildcard certs are stored in a directory minus the leading "*". For example, certs for `*.exmple.com` are stored in `~/.mdm/certs/.example.com`

A user can add existing [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certs in these dirs, or set up a system to automatically deploy/retrieve certs to those direcorties much like the MDM demo domain for the Magento team.


## How MDM handles certs with a fallback strategy

1. MDM will first look for a current, valid, existing cert in the hostname dir.
2. If valid hostname cert is not available, MDM will look for a valid wildcard cert dir. If that exists, it will be copied to the hostname dir.
3. If the hostname and wildcard certs are not available, then MDM will create one in the hostname dir with `mkcert` (if enabled).
4. If `mkcert` is not enabled, then an invalid cert created for `localhost` will be used. Browsers will show the site as invalid but will likely allow the user to proceed. In Chrome, to bypass invalid certs, the user must type "_thisisunsafe_" in the site's tab.

## The preferred order explained

[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) are real certs that should be accepted by **all browsers** on **all hosts**. Certs from `mkcert` are only valid on the host with the CA installed, and while they are valid for 10 yrs, more browsers are choosing to reject very long lived certs. `mkcert` also imposes additional responsibility on the user. If the user's CA is compromised, a "valid" spoofed cert may be created for a malicious web service attempting to steal credentials. While unlikely that the CA would be compromised without the rest of the user's system also being compromised, the user should understand this risk.

## (Re)starting new web services

Each time a new web service is added (or an existing one restarted), MDM will check that every found web service hostname resolves to `127.0.0.1` (a.k.a. `localhost`) and that a cert is provided by the fallback strategy outlined above. Then MDM will dynamically create the necessary nginx config for each service to be handle by the reverse proxy listening on local ports 80 & 443.

# MDM Developers

## Recommended IDE & Extensions

IDE: [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

IDE Extensions:
1. [Bash Debug](https://github.com/rogalmic/vscode-bash-debug)
1. [BASH IDE](https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server)
1. [Bats](https://github.com/jetmartin/bats)
1. [shellcheck](https://github.com/timonwong/vscode-shellcheck)

The included `.vscode/launch.json` has some useful debug scenarios pre-configured that you can use to step through.


## Development on a Mac

### 1. clone this repo

```
$ git clone https://github.com/PMET-public/mdm.git && cd mdm
```

### 2. configure additional features

```
cp .mdm_config.tmpl.sh .mdm_config.sh
```

### 3. set up your env

```
$ export debug=1 MDM_REPO_DIR=. COMPOSER_AUTH='{"github-oauth":{"github.com":"..."}}'
```

## Additional troubleshooting notes

To debug the launching script, run `export debug_launcher=1`, too. This is currently a separate var because the launching script debug output would otherwise display (and disrupt) the menu output before the logging initialization can run. Also, the launching script debug output (bundled with each app) is the output of the app's `<osx_appp>/Contents/Resources/script`, not the output of `~/.mdm/current/launcher`.  The launcher should not need to be debugged often because it's relatively minimal, stable code to bootstrap the app.

## Application Configuration For Development

### Configuration of MDM
|Feature|Config Param|
|-|---|
| Public Certs |`mdm_domain`|
| |`mdm_domain_fullchain_gh_url`|
| |`mdm_domain_privkey_gh_url`|
| | |
| Remote Support/Access |`mdm_tmate_authorized_keys_url`|
| | |
| Public Web Access|`mdm_tunnel_domain`|
| |`mdm_tunnel_ssh_url`|
| |`mdm_tunnel_pk_url`|

### Configuration of an MDM app

## Running tests

MDM uses [Bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) for testing. You'll find all tests in the numbered subdirectories of `tests`.

Example #1: Call all tests in all immediate subdirectories of the specified one and show test timings.
```
./tests/libs/bats/bin/bats -T ./tests/1-generic-lib-and-non-app-specific/**/*.bats
```

Example #2: Call all tests recursively for the specified dir and show test timings.
```
./tests/libs/bats/bin/bats -T -r ./tests/2-dockerize-then-run-detached-app
```

See `.gitub/workflows` for additional example invocations. 

## Debugging

A VSCode launch file (`.vscode/launch.json`) containing many debugging examples is included. Stepping through example debug configurations is a great way to become familiar with the control flow of MDM.

## Publishing releases

MDM checks the [releases](https://github.com/PMET-public/mdm/releases) page for the version of the most recent release. If that release is a newer semantic version, the user will be prompted to update. This system will need to be updated at some point if there are multiple major & minor releases.

## Updating the README for menu updates

Part of this README is auto generated by script. When menu items are changed, the script should be re-run and the output paste into this file.
